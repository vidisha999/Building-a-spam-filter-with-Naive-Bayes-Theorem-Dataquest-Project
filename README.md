# Building-a-spam-filter-with-Naive-Bayes-Theorem-Dataquest-Project

## project Focus

The goal of this project tio build a spam filter to classify messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which  estimates the  probabilities and classifies new messages by calculating the probabillities for both spam and non spam messages.
The classification made by Naive Bayes algorithm is based on the probability values.If the probability of the spam messages is higher than that of the non-spam messages, it classifies the new message as a spam message.

## Project Background 

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is a probabilistic classifier  that is based on Bayes' theorem, which is commonly used  to calculate the probability distribution of text data, with features that represent discrete frequencies or counts of events in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

The Bayesian model is a supesrvised learning model that estimates the posterior probability of a event given the prior probability of the model, once more evidence becomes available. The Naive Bayes theorem uses the basic assumption, features in a dataset are independent and there are three main types of it, which include Gaussian Naive Bayes for continuous data, Multinomial Naive Bayes for discrete data, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for binary/boolean features.

 ## Data 
 This classification task is performed on the dataset of 5,572 messages extracted from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
